<h1><i>Recipes</i> - The Odin Project</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is a solution to The Odin Project's Foundations Course's first project: <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes">Recipes</a>.

<p>It consists of building the structure of a website consisting of Recipes, including a homepage (index) that contains links to three different recipe pages.</p>

<p>Each one of those pages contains the recipe's name, a picture of the dish, a description, the ingredients and the preparation steps. They also contain a link to return to the homepage (index).</p>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>

<p>This project is mostly HTML-based, as a mean to practice what was studied so far in the course. Therefore, the project requires the understanding of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The HTML <i>Boilerplate</i></li>
    <li>Metadata</li>
    <li>Elements and tags</li>
    <li>Headings and paragraphs</li>
    <li>Working with hyperlink references and images</li>
    <li>Ordered and unordered lists</li>
</ul> 

<p>Working with the Unix CLI and having basic knowledge of Git and Github were integral to the project.</p>
